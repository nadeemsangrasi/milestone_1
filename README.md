# Milestone 1 Project - Hello World in Next.js

This project marks the beginning of our journey into Next.js development, serving as the first milestone. The primary goal was to get familiar with setting up a Next.js environment, understanding the file structure, and rendering a basic "Hello World" page.

## Project Overview

This milestone project is a part of the **Next.js Code Circle for Senior Students**, guided by **Sir Ameen Alam**. The focus of this milestone is to solidify our understanding of:

- **Setting Up the Environment**: Installing Node.js, creating a new Next.js project, and configuring the development environment.
- **Understanding File Structure**: Learning about the default Next.js folder structure, including `pages`, `public`, and `styles`.
- **Rendering a Basic Page**: Creating a simple "Hello World" page to understand the basics of routing and rendering in Next.js.

## Learnings

Throughout this milestone, we focused on:

1. **Setting Up the Environment**: Ensuring that the development environment is correctly configured for Next.js projects.
2. **File Structure**: Gaining an understanding of the core directories and files in a Next.js project and how they contribute to the overall architecture.
3. **Basic Page Rendering**: Writing and rendering a basic component in Next.js to display "Hello World" on the browser.
